<h1>Professional Experience</h1>
<div class="section">
  <h2>Fave Media, Inc. <span class="url">www.getfave.com</span> <span class="location">Chicago, IL</span></h2>
  <div class="position">
    <h3>Technical Lead <span class="date">September 2008 &#8211; Current</span></h3>
    <p class="technologies"><strong>Technologies &amp; Methodologies:</strong> Ruby on Rails, Sphinx, Amazon S3, AJAX, Git, Capistrano, MySQL, Scrum</p>
    <p>Fave Media, a national video yellow pages and business directory, launched in 2007 and has rapidly grown to be one of the major players in the small business online directory vertical. Their flagship product <a href="http://www.getfave.com">getfave.com</a> attracts over 2 million unique visitors a month. I came on board in September of 2008 and have lead and grown the team from two to five developers. Some of the notable projects include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Hosting Migration: I oversaw a migration between hosts in early 2009. This process required parallel environments, the development of a read-only mode, performance benchmarking, and some DNS wizardry. When the switch was flipped we were able to transition all traffic with zero down time.</li>
      <li>Data Updates: Getfave.com relies on an outside vendor for their 17+ million business listings. Every month they publish changesets affecting over 50% of that data. I oversaw the development of a project that fetched, analyzed and crunched these massive sets of changes.</li>
      <li>Process: Using Scrum methodologies, which I learned independently and from other peers, I built the team from two to five developers. We maintain weekly sprints, daily stand-ups, and harvest a culture where innovation is palpable.</li>
      <li>Highrise Integration: Getfave.com brings in hundreds of new users and businesses every day. The challenge: empowering a team of sales representatives with this data. I took a &#8220;buy vs. build&#8221; approach to the problem and, working with the Highrise API, developed a solution that has scaled to tens of thousands of leads.</li>
      <li>Advertising Revenue: While at getfave.com, I&#8217;ve been responsible for managing the advertising on the site, including our own internal inventory, Google AdSense and AdSense for search.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Gorilla <span class="url">www.gorillachicago.com</span> <span class="location">Chicago, IL</span></h2>
  <p>I had a fantastic opportunity to work with a range of exclusively web based technologies at Gorilla. As a small web consultancy, I pushed for and affected the introduction of agile development processes, such as test driven development and pair programming. I also introduced Rails as a viable web platform, and demonstrated its effectiveness with <a href="http://spexchicago.com" target="_blank">spexchicago.com</a>. I introduced and migrated Gorilla to Google Apps for all email, calendar, and chat services.</p>

    <h3>Engineer <span class="date">February 2008 &#8211; September 2008</span></h3>
    <p class="technologies"><strong>Technologies</strong>: Ruby on Rails, C#, ASP.NET 2.0, PHP, ColdFusion, Flash, AJAX, ImageMagick, RMagick, Prototype, Script.aculo.us, JQuery, NHibernate, Subversion, Capistrano, MySQL, SQL Server</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://subzero.com/" target="_blank">Subzero</a>: This site was one of the more elaborate ASP.NET sites I&#8217;ve had the opportunity to work on. We worked with NHibernate to facilitate data access, and utilized the ASP.NET AJAX Extensions and toolkit extensively to make the interface rich and interactive. Working with a world class design firm also put my XHTML and CSS skills to the test.</li>
      <li><a href="http://spexchicago.com/" target="_blank">Spex Chicago</a>: I built this site entirely from scratch using Ruby on Rails 2.1. Working alongside a designer who favored JQuery as opposed to Prototype and Script.aculo.us, we were still able to accomplish elaborate visual animations and AJAX integration throughout the front end. The administrative interface, with which I had the opportunity to express much creative license, includes image size validation with ImageMagick and a clever customization of ActiveRecord.</li>
      <li><a href="http://northpointhorizons.com" target="_blank">Northpoint Horizons</a>: I had the opportunity to build this site from front to back with ASP.NET and C#. It features a Microsoft SQL Server back end that uses stored procedures to communicate to a custom data layer. Business objects, consuming that information, feed values to the user interface, which I also constructed from the ground up. Northpoint was another site that exercised my design abilities with a very graphic-heavy front end.</li>
      <li>Maintenance: As a web consultancy, Gorilla always offered the chance to get involved with maintaining many of their exisiting sites, including: <a href="http://homemadepizza.com" target="_blank">HomeMade Pizza</a>, <a href="http://subzero.com" target="_blank">SubZero/Wolf Appliance</a>, <a href="http://carecenter.org" target="_blank">Midwest Palliative CareCenter</a>, <a href="http://vfw.org" target="_blank">Veterans of Foreign Wars</a>.</li>
