    <p>
      When building products it’s so important to be close to your
      customers. You want to know what they’re thinking and feeling.
      Customer support is a great channel for that. In this talk I gave over
      lunch at TaskRabbit, I explored what getting close to your customers
      might actually look like in a perfect world.

      <time>March 2011</time>
    </h2>

    <p>
      In most web apps, JS and CSS are a mess. There are few conventions
      when it comes to organizing these assets and modularizing them can
      introduce the HTTP overhead of multiple requests. In this talk, I
      discuss a Rack-based approach to packaging assets using a lightweight
      gem called Stork. I covered organizational conventions, advanced CSS
      techniques with Sass, and simple ways to modularize your JS all while
      sending a tightly packaged set of assets to the browser.
