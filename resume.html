        I’ve taught six ten-week sections of General Assembly’s Front-End

          <strong>Curriculum</strong>: When I joined General Assembly, the
          curriculum they had developed left a lot to be desired so I
          developed my own instead from scratch. There are dozens of
          exercises, quizzes, and lessons that I've customized to effectively
          teach the topics of HTML, CSS, and JS.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>High Praise</strong>: For each course, I received consistently
          high feedback (70+ <abbr title="Net Promoter Score">NPS</abbr>) both
          on the quality of instruction and the curriculum. Testimonials and
          references available upon request.

      <p>
        I joined TaskRabbit as a Senior Software Engineer on the Rabbit Web
        team. Initially, I worked alongside a couple other engineers and
        designers to build better tools for the people running tasks. In my
        second quarter, I became the tech lead of the business services team,
        which built tools for businesses that used TaskRabbit at higher volume.
        I was laid off in July along with about 15 other great friends and
        colleagues.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Intellihelp</strong>: The customer support team at
          TaskRabbit dealt with an enormous amount of inbound inquiries. For
          a hack-day project, I worked with the support lead to build a
          tool that reduced inbound inquires by 12%. Intellihelp leveraged
          Zendesk’s API to help customers find topical support topics.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Task Close Potential</strong>: This project also came out
          of efforts of my colleages on a hack-day. Task Close Potential (TCP)
          was a numeric value that helped the company prioritize incoming
          applications. Applicants in popular areas with open schedules were
          given a high TCP and reviewed first.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Getting Closer to Your Customers</strong>: I presented to
          the entire company over lunch about the value of getting closer to
          customers. I explored some ideas that blurred the lines between
          support and customer development.

      </p>

      <p>
        Fave Media, a national “video yellow pages” and business directory,
        launched in 2007 and rapidly grew to be one of the major players in
        the space. Their flagship product getfave.com drove 20 million requests
        per month through organic search. Eventually, search engines changed
        their algorithms, traffic waned, and Fave Media went out of business. I
        came on board in September of 2008 leading and growing the team from two
        to five engineers before leaving to start my own business in January of
        2010.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Data</strong>: Fave used an outside vendor, Localeze, for
          their 17+ million business listings. Every month this vendor
          published changesets affecting over 50% of that data. I oversaw
          the development of a project that fetched, analyzed and crunched
          these massive sets of changes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>People</strong>: Using Scrum methodologies, which I
          learned independently and from other peers, I built the team from
          two to five engineers. We maintained weekly sprints, daily
          stand-ups and fostered a culture that promoted innovation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sales</strong>: Fave brought in hundreds of new users and
          businesses every day. The challenge: empowering a team of sales
          representatives with this data. I took a “buy vs. build” approach
          to the problem and, working with the Highrise API, developed a
          solution that scaled to tens of thousands of leads.

      I had a fantastic opportunity to work with a range of exclusively

      <p>
        I built Spex Chicago's website entirely from scratch using Ruby on Rails
        2.1. Working alongside a designer who favored jQuery as opposed to
        Prototype and Script.aculo.us, we implemented elaborate visual
        animations and AJAX integration throughout the front-end. The
        administrative interface, where I had the opportunity to express much
        creative license, featured image size validation with ImageMagick and a
        clever customization of ActiveRecord. The site has since been
        redesigned.

        consuming that information, fed values to the user interface, which I
        also constructed from the ground up. Northpoint was another site that
        exercised my design abilities with a very graphic-heavy front end. The
        site has since been redesigned.

      Sqoot is a local deal API that makes it easy for developers and online
      publishers to monetize their apps and websites. We integrated with
      almost 100 local deal providers. For each provider, we would aggregate
      and normalize deal data, which we’d then expose through our API. The
      API allows users to filter deals by location, category, and price. The
      API also allowed customers to track impressions, clicks, and
      purchases in real-time. Sqoot was acquired by Clutch in 2013.

        <strong>Scale</strong>: Every day, our API served tens of thousands

      <li>
        <strong>Data Normalization</strong>: With almost 100 data sources,
        the biggest challenge was parsing and normalizing each data set.
        Background processes would clean, categorize, and localize every
        deal and merchant as it entered the system.

    <p>
      In most web apps, JS and CSS are a mess. There are few conventions
      when it comes to organizing these assets and modularizing them can
      introduce the HTTP overhead of multiple requests. In this talk, I
      discuss a Rack-based approach to packaging assets using a lightweight

      techniques with Sass, and simple ways to modularize your JS all while
      sending a tightly packaged set of assets to the browser.
