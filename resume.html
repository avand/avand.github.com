<div class="box section">
  <h2>Fave Media, Inc. <span class="url">www.getfave.com</span> <span class="location">Chicago, IL</span></h2>
  <div class="position">
    <h3>Technical Lead <span class="date">September 2008 &#8211; January 2010</span></h3>
    <p class="technologies"><strong>Technologies &amp; Methodologies:</strong> Ruby on Rails, Sphinx, Amazon S3, AJAX, Git, Capistrano, MySQL, Scrum</p>
    <p>Fave Media, a national video yellow pages and business directory, launched in 2007 and has rapidly grown to be one of the major players in the small business online directory vertical. Their flagship product <a href="http://www.getfave.com">getfave.com</a> drove 20 million requests a month. I came on board in September of 2008 leading and growing the team from two to five developers. Some of the notable projects include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Data Updates: Getfave.com relies on an outside vendor for their 17+ million business listings. Every month they publish changesets affecting over 50% of that data. I oversaw the development of a project that fetched, analyzed and crunched these massive sets of changes.</li>
      <li>Process: Using Scrum methodologies, which I learned independently and from other peers, I built the team from two to five developers. We maintain weekly sprints, daily stand-ups, and harvest a culture where innovation is palpable.</li>
      <li>Highrise Integration: Getfave.com brings in hundreds of new users and businesses every day. The challenge: empowering a team of sales representatives with this data. I took a &#8220;buy vs. build&#8221; approach to the problem and, working with the Highrise API, developed a solution that has scaled to tens of thousands of leads.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Gorilla <span class="url">www.gorillachicago.com</span> <span class="location">Chicago, IL</span></h2>
  <p>I had a fantastic opportunity to work with a range of exclusively web based technologies at Gorilla. As a small web consultancy, I pushed for and affected the introduction of agile development processes, such as test driven development and pair programming. I also introduced Rails as a viable web platform, and demonstrated its effectiveness with <a href="http://spexchicago.com" target="_blank">spexchicago.com</a>. I introduced and migrated Gorilla to Google Apps for all email, calendar, and chat services.</p>

    <h3>Engineer <span class="date">February 2008 &#8211; September 2008</span></h3>
    <p class="technologies"><strong>Technologies:</strong> Ruby on Rails, C#, ASP.NET 2.0, PHP, ColdFusion, Flash, AJAX, ImageMagick, RMagick, Prototype, Script.aculo.us, JQuery, NHibernate, Subversion, Capistrano, MySQL, SQL Server</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://spexchicago.com/" target="_blank">Spex Chicago</a>: I built this site entirely from scratch using Ruby on Rails 2.1. Working alongside a designer who favored JQuery as opposed to Prototype and Script.aculo.us, we were still able to accomplish elaborate visual animations and AJAX integration throughout the front end. The administrative interface, with which I had the opportunity to express much creative license, includes image size validation with ImageMagick and a clever customization of ActiveRecord.</li>
      <li><a href="http://northpointhorizons.com" target="_blank">Northpoint Horizons</a>: I had the opportunity to build this site from front to back with ASP.NET and C#. It features a Microsoft SQL Server back end that uses stored procedures to communicate to a custom data layer. Business objects, consuming that information, feed values to the user interface, which I also constructed from the ground up. Northpoint was another site that exercised my design abilities with a very graphic-heavy front end.</li>
