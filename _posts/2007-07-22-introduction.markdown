title: Introduction to this Blog
---

Throughout my life, I’ve always had a knack for design. As a kid, I grew up in a house surrounded by fine art and lots of art classes. In my teens, I spent my Saturdays at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. However, along the way, I also feel in love with technology. I love computers, gadgets, iPhones, the internet, and especially web design.

So throughout my day to day trials and tribulations, I come across things that pique my interest. Design and usability flaws that are so minor that most people steam right over them. Some might call them insignificant, but I believe it’s important to be picky. It’s what ultimately separates the wheat from the chafe.

Simple things like why a refrigerator ice dispenser doesn’t revert back to “Water” after a few minutes of inactivity? Why North Face stores don't have a coat racks? Why a brand new OS might have a wonderful animation library of fades and shadows but then abruptly blink to life when waking up. Why certain applications are huge successes, and others fall to the curb?

These are all questions that interest me, and that I hope to explore with this blog. The theme has a long chain to roam on but will stay within the intersection of design and technology, with a few usability and user experience tangents along the way.

I hope you enjoy it,

Avand
