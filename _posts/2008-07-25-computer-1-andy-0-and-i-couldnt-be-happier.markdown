title: Computer 1, Andy 0 and I Couldn't Be Happier
---
In my own time, I've been dabbling with some pretty hardcore machine learning. Trying to answer the question of how a computer can create a relationship between two things, blocks of text in this case. Turns out with a few matrix transpositions, single value decompositions, cosine similiarities, latent semantic index, and a [naive Baysian filter](http://www.igvita.com/2007/05/23/bayes-classification-in-ruby/) to boot, you can get pretty close. And I was just _dabbling_.

I was blown away by how accurately the computer, when told what _kinds_ of things to look for, could create associations between data for itself. I had to force myself to avoid using my head to solve the problem, and pass the buck to the machines. But this is nothing new - Google has been doing it for a while - and it seems to be trend, if not a revolution, [according to WIRED](http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/magazine/16-07/pb_theory).

The problem with this whole movement is that unless you're a math Ph.D., it's completely counterintuitive. You've spent 20-60 years training your brain, and here comes a computer (or a whole bunch of them, it turns out) that knows more than you do in the span of a few minutes. How is this possible?

Well, isn't in the end your brain doing pretty much the same thing, maybe with a dash of evolutionary preprogramming? If you subscribe to theory of [tabula rasa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabula_rasa), we're not much further along than a blinking terminal window when we're born. It's just a little unnerving that a machine can go from infant to prophet in minutes where it takes humans years. But, hey, we've had other problems to deal with, too (balance, speech, survival, etc.) - take that Mr. Fancy Computer.

But this isn't even about computers. It's just raw math; the type of math I hope to someday wrap my head around, if only slightly. Humans are selfish, egotistical, and prideful - all things that math could not care less about. You don't "solve for x" with empathy. And it's that stark, cold, unforgiving nature of a white board filled head to toe with equations that makes us layman turn to each other and say "pish posh - I'm a _human_, I'll _always_ know better than an equation." But, like I said, in my dabbling, I've found that nothing could be further to the truth, and if that  means the computer wins, I'm OK with that.
