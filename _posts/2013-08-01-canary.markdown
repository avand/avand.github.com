The last product I built, [Sqoot][s], had a lot of moving parts. We
had three databases, a search server, an API, website, and a deal
importing system. It's a marvel that it worked at all! The truth is
that it went down pretty frequently. Sadly, our customers were often
the first to find out even though we went to great lengths to
[monitor our apps][1].

After Sqoot, I [briefly][tc] worked at [TaskRabbit][tr]. Because we
had an operations team I didn't have to think about whether or not
our code was running. But I did still have to worry about the code
itself: thousands of lines scattered across a bunch of apps. We
wrote lots of tests to prevent bugs. The slowest tests were our
integration tests. These tests actually boot up a server and clicked
around the site in a browser like a customer would. These tests were
so frustratingly slow that [Rob Robbins][rr] and I dreamt up
[Specford][sf]. And still anytime someone on my team wanted to push
a change, we'd wait 15-20 minutes for the tests to run. Our test
suite was the biggest adversary to our speed.

Paradoxically, our code still broke in production. If you want to
know with 100% confidence that things are "up," you just need to
check production. There are a few services that will do this kind of
monitoring for you but theyâ€™re either hard to use, expensive, or
both. I want a service that's affordable and well designed. So I'm
building it.

[Canary][c] is an uptime monitoring service. Canary tells you when
things go wrong before anyone else does. Currently Canary will
monitor a URL and send an alert if the URL doesn't respond or
responds unsuccessfully. There are no usage limits or tiered
subscriptions; $5/mo gets you everything.

I've teamed up with my friend and previous co-founder,
[Brandon][bw]. We've built great things in the past and are really
excited to build out all the ideas we have for Canary.

[Try out Canary][c] free for 14 days. I'd love hear your early
feedback.
