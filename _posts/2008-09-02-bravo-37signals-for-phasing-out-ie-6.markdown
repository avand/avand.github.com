Too much time has gone by with developers forced to limit their imaginations, creativity and ability to support the [rusty weight of IE 6](http://37signals.blogs.com/products/2008/07/basecamp-phasin.html). But most websites have been afraid to stick their neck out.

So, kudos to you, 37Signals, for doing your part to rid the world of IE6.
