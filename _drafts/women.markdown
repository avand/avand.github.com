For better or for worse, I've spent a lot of time studying the dynamics between men and women. It's a pretty hot topic these days. [Neil "Style"  Strauss][6] published [The Game][1], a very popular break down of the art of "the pick up." VH1's series, [The Pickup Artist][2] tails [Erik James Horvat-Markovic][3], known simply as "Mystery", whose one of the topics leading experts. Dating coaches travel the world and teach seminars all year round. But beyond the hype, there's several fascinating similarities I've discovered between picking up women and running a business.

## The Approach

Let me describe a typical situation that frustrates guys: across the bar there's a couple attractive girls sitting with one guy. Who is that guy? Maybe a boyfriend, making the other girl single? Unless they're waiting for a fourth? Or maybe he's that overly-protective close friend? Think about it too long and he's become some James Bond derivative with both girls vying for his attention. Come on! He's just another guy; AT&T drops his calls just like everyone else's.

The truth is that there's only one way to find out who that third girl is: talk to her. I've been involved in three startups to date. The first, ClassHub, was an ambitious project designed to bring students together based on similarities in their course curriculum. Next up, [PiggyBack.it][4], a much more manageable product that just keeps track of debts between friends. Now, I'm working on [dish86][5], which helps people coordinate dinner plans. Each project was riddled with questions: is the market big enough, will people use it, will people pay for it... how will it make money? Fortunately, with business, you can take the time to answer many of these looming questions. But at the end of the day, just like with girls, you just have to believe in yourself and go for it.

Contrastingly, when a window of opportunity closes, everyone grabs for an excuse. "I was trying to get another drink," "I had to use the bathroom," or "they weren't that hot anyway," are some of my personal favorites. Anyone can be the idea guy but only a small handful of those with an idea actually pull the trigger.

## The Pickup Line

Mystery says that when you're approaching someone you're interested in "the first 30 seconds buy you the next minute." In other words, you've got to instantly bring value to the table. When starting a business, you're hopefully building a product or service that adds value to your users. In social dynamics, whether you like it or not, we immediately break down each other's value propositions.

The rich, the famous, and the beautiful are generally perceived as being high value individuals. Don't fall in that category? Not a problem. Stand up straight, speak more loudly, and dress well - fake it 'till you make it. Take a more active approach by surrounding yourself with friends that at least appear to be having a good time. Still struggling? Hire a photographer to follow you around for a night snapping photos as you go from bar to bar (Mystery's idea, not mine). Become the producer instead of the consumer; come to the table with something to add, not to take away and your value proposition soars.

The same holds true for your business. Unless you're running a scam, you can't expect to gain a customer without giving them something back in return. That's how marketing works: paint a perception of value to later exchange it with your customer. Hopefully, for cash. Some products, like celebrities, speak for themselves; their value is obvious. But if you're not famous and your idea's not that glamorous, quickly explore other ways to demonstrate higher value.

The "elevator pitch" is born from this philosophy: express the most valuable part your product or service in 30 seconds. It's an invaluable practice. If you can't convey high amounts of value quickly, you (and your idea) will be rejected.

## Rejected!

Speaking of rejection, whether you're on your first date or your first startup, brace yourself for a boat load.

In the dating world, rejection is considered pretty simple: no generally just means no. In business you can afford to be a bit more persistent. Good things come with time. If you're doing things right you should be getting tons of feedback about your idea. At TechStars for a Day, where I pitched PiggyBack.it, Micah Baldwin drove this point home: whatever you're doing is wrong. So get ready for it.

But in actuality, dating is very similar. If you're tactful, a no just means "not now." (It's probably worth noting that often no really does just mean no.) Real Social Dynamics, one of the more polished dating guides out there devotes a lot of time to this topic. It comes down to what they call "buying temperature." Hit an awkward lull in the conversation? Buying temperatures are low. Probably not the best time to go for that number. But if you can pivot, realizing the state of affairs and reacting to change them, she might soon be laughing again.

## Close

It's no surprise to me that these similarities exist. My business partner, Mo Yehia, and I have observed many of the same similarities between Gordon Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares and the startup incubator we're a part of. Effective social dynamics are a skill that cut across all walks of life.
