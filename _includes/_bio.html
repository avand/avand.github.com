<p class="bio">
  I am a full-stack software engineer, product designer, and teacher. I’ve been working on the web for <a href="/resume">over a decade</a> and am passionate about building great products.<br><br>

  I currently work at <a href="https://www.airbnb.com" target="_blank">Airbnb</a>, where I help internal product teams stay abreast with customer feedback. Before that, I was at <a href="http://mysteryscience.com" target="_blank">Mystery Science</a>, transforming how elementary school teachers teach science. And since 2013, I’ve worked on-and-off with General Assembly, teaching aspiring developers what I know about <a href="http://fewd.avandamiri.com/">front-end web development</a>.<br><br>

  I was born in Boston, grew up in Salt Lake City, and spent many years living in Chicago. Now, I call San Francisco my home.<br><br>

  I’m an aspiring rock climber. I have a love affair with music and cars, especially vintage BMWs and Volkswagens. One day, I’ll buy a van and transform it into an offroad-capable camping rig.<br><br>

  But that’s enough about me. How can I help you?
