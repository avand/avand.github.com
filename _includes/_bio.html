  I’ve been working on the web for <a href="/resume">over a decade</a> and am passionate about building great products.<br><br>

  I devote most of my time to building <a href="https://lopery.com/?utm_source=avands-website&utm_medium=bio" target="_blank">Lopery</a>,
  a free budgeting that helps people spend with confidence, recover from the unexpected, and achieve financial independence. I used simple
  (but time consuming) budgeting principles to <a href="https://medium.com/@avand/budget-to-a-free-house-7b53eff6ac89" target="_blank">buy my first home</a>.
  Now, I'm codifying (pun intended) those same principles into an easy to use app that helps people achieve their financial goals.<br><br>

  My last job was with <a href="https://www.airbnb.com" target="_blank">Airbnb</a>, where I focused on internal products
  that helped teams measure the quality of the software they were building. I also built internal tools for employees to
  <a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/hacking-human-connection-the-story-of-awedience-ebf66ee6af0e" target="_blank">stay more connected</a>,
  especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. Before that, I was lead engineer at
  <a href="http://mysteryscience.com" target="_blank">Mystery Science</a>, the #1 way in which science is now taught in U.S. elementary school classroms.
  For a while, I also taught with <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/" target="_blank">General Assembly</a>, teaching aspiring developers
  the basics of <a href="http://fewd.avandamiri.com/">front-end web development</a>.<br><br>

  I was born in Boston, grew up in Salt Lake City, and spent many years living in Chicago. In 2013, I came out West to San Francisco, which I called home
  for almost a decade. Now, I’m based out <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/42230765" target="_blank">Mariposa</a>, in the foothills of the Sierras.<br><br>

  I enjoy the great outdoors and absolutely love <a href="http://avand.fm">music and dance</a>. Cars have been an lifelong obsession of mine.
  I’m the proud owner of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/avanduh/">a 2002 E-250 Sportsmobile van</a>, and he and I have enjoyed many trips to
  beautiful and remote parts of the Pacific North West spreading good vibes. I also have a very soft spot for magic (slight of hand, in particular).
  I love the feeling of being inspired and absolutely love inspiring others.<br><br>

  What can I do for you?
