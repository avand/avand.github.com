<p class="bio">
  I am a full-stack software engineer, product designer, and part-time teacher. I’ve been working on the web for <a href="/resume">over a decade</a> and am passionate about building great products.<br><br>

  Most recently, I worked at <a href="http://mysteryscience.com">Mystery Science</a>, transforming how elementary school teachers teach science. And since 2013, I’ve worked with General Assembly, teaching <a href="http://fewd.avandamiri.com/">what I know</a> about web development.<br><br>

  I was born in Boston, grew up in Salt Lake City, and spent many years living in Chicago. Now, I call San Francisco my home.<br><br>

  I’m an aspiring rock climber. I have a love affair with music and cars, especially vintage BMWs and Volkswagens. One day, I’ll buy a van and transform it into an offroad-capable camping rig.<br><br>

  But that’s enough about me. How can I help you?
