<p class="bio">
  I’m a product designer and full-stack software engineer and I’ve been designing and building products for over a <a href="resume.html">decade</a>. For the last few years, I was Director of Product at <a href="http://mysteryscience.com">Mystery Science</a> helping elementary teachers teach science. I’m passionate about learning and will, on occasion, teach people what I know about web development at <a href="http://fewd.avandamiri.com/">General Assembly</a>. I was born in Boston, grew up in Salt Lake City, and spent several years living in Chicago. Now, I call San Francisco my home. I’m an aspiring rock climber. I have a love affair with <a href="https://tunes.avandamiri.com">music</a> and cars, especially vintage BMWs and Volkswagens. I daydream of buying a van and transforming it into an offroad-capable camping rig. I live in the moment and often capture them too both <a href="http://photos.avandamiri.com" target="_blank">personally</a> and <a href="http://irishgoodbyesf.com" target="_blank">professionally</a>.
