<p class="bio">
  I’ve been working on the web for <a href="/resume">over a decade</a> and am passionate about building great products.<br><br>

  My last job was with <a href="https://www.airbnb.com" target="_blank">Airbnb</a>, where I focused on internal products
  that helped teams measure the quality of the software they were building. I also built internal tools for employees
  to stay more connected, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. Before that, I was lead engineer at
  <a href="http://mysteryscience.com" target="_blank">Mystery Science</a>, the #1 way in which science is taught in U.S. elementary school classroms.
  For a while, I also taught with <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/" target="_blank">General Assembly</a>, teaching aspiring developers
  the basics of <a href="http://fewd.avandamiri.com/">front-end web development</a>.<br><br>

  I was born in Boston, grew up in Salt Lake City, and spent many years living in Chicago. Now, I call San Francisco my home
  and <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/42230765" target="_blank">Mariposa</a> my home away from home.<br><br>

  I enjoy the great outdoors and absolutely love <a href="http://avand.fm">music and dance</a>. Cars have been an lifelong obsession of mine,
  especially vintage BMWs and Volkswagens. I’m the proud owner of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/avanduh/">a 2002 E-250 Sportsmobile van</a>,
  and he and I have enjoyed many trips to beautiful and remote parts of the West Coast to create good vibes.<br><br>

  What can I do for you?
