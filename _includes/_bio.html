<p class="bio">
  I am a full-stack software engineer, product designer, and teacher. I’ve been working on the web for <a href="/resume">over a decade</a> and am passionate about building great products.<br><br>

  I currently work at <a href="https://www.airbnb.com" target="_blank">Airbnb</a>, where I work on internal products that help the company build quality software that customers love. Before that, I was at <a href="http://mysteryscience.com" target="_blank">Mystery Science</a>, transforming how elementary school teachers teach science. For a while, I also taught with General Assembly, teaching aspiring developers the basics of <a href="http://fewd.avandamiri.com/">front-end web development</a>.<br><br>

  I was born in Boston, grew up in Salt Lake City, and spent many years living in Chicago. Now, I call San Francisco my home.<br><br>

  I enjoy the great outdoors and absolutely love music and dance. Cars have been an lifelong obsession of mine, especially vintage BMWs and Volkswagens. I’m the very proud owner of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/avanduh/">a van, duh</a>, and he and I plan to one day visit all the national parks and baseball stadiums. Then, off to Central America. A man can dream :)<br><br>

  What can I do for you?
