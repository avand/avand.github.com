<p class="bio">
  I’m a product designer, programmer, and teacher. I’ve been working on the web for <a href="resume.html">over a decade</a>. I am currently searching for the <a href="https://medium.com/@avand/one-mans-search-for-the-perfect-job-90caad5d5b9f#.xdwrlmruf">perfect job</a>.<br><br>

   Most recently, I was Director of Product at <a href="http://mysteryscience.com">Mystery Science</a>, transforming how elementary school teachers teach science. And since 2013, I’ve worked with General Assembly, teaching <a href="http://fewd.avandamiri.com/">what I know</a> about web development.<br><br>

  I was born in Boston, grew up in Salt Lake City, and spent many years living in Chicago. Now, I call San Francisco my home.<br><br>

  I’m an aspiring rock climber. I have a love affair with music and cars, especially vintage BMWs and Volkswagens. I daydream of buying a van and transforming it into an offroad-capable camping rig.<br><br>

  But that’s enough about me. How can I help you?
