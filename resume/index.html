      Sr. Software Engineer, Internal Products

    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Awedience</strong>: In response to the pandemic, I created a
        virtual auditorium product that brings the company together during
        remote company meetings. Employees virtually sit around live-streamed
        content, expressing emoji-responses and short messages from their seats
        in real-time. <a href="vimeo.com/685654010" target="_blank">Watch a 2 minute demo</a> (password:

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Internal jobs board</strong>: I contributed to a job board
        employees could use to find new opportunities, integrated with existing
        recruiting tools. Think careers.airbnb.com but specifically for employees.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Team pages</strong>: I contributed to the internal team browser,
        featuring hierarchical navigation, and customizable team pages.
      </li>
    </ul>

      Sr. Software Engineer, Quality, Feedback & Bugs
    </h3>

    <p class="technologies">
      Ruby, Rails 5.x, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, SQL, Airflow
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Bug reporting</strong>: I built an integration to CS tools that enables
        bug reports to be quickly and easily captured alongside customer tickets.
        I also maintained the web and mobile tools employees used to file bugs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Prioritization & alerts</strong>: I built a tool for product teams to
        quantify the impact of bugs, performance, accessibility, security, and availability.
        Integrating Jira and CS tools, it also sends interactive notifications to
        teams via Slack that dramatically decreases triage time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Feedback widget</strong>: I created reusable customer-facing feedback intake component
        that became backbone of an internal tool teams use to explore 7.5k+ entries/mo
        from over 20+ installs site-wide.
      </li>

    <h3>
      Going Above & Beyond

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Core Values interviewer</strong>: Interviewed hundreds of applicants including
        executive level candidates and contributed to evaluation rubric that was adopted company-wide.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Engineering Meeting</strong>: I voluntarily produced this quarterly meeting for two years.
        I inspired hundreds of engineers to participate & contribute, up-leveled content, developed segments,
        and directed live shows, streamed worldwide.

      the bait and the 5 minutes we shared on stage during an all-company meeting
      may go down as the most entertaining moment I’ve ever had on stage.

      “I wanted to say thank you for being such an incredible ambassador for our
      culture and values at Airbnb. You truly embody [the CEO’s] principles of being
      an ‘owner and not a renter,’ champion the mission in all that you do, and bring
      us all closer together as employees.”

      “Avand is a unique combination of passionate and action oriented. He has
      been a tireless promoter of quality not just because it’s the right thing
      for hosts and guests and our products, but because he wants to actively
      promote and enable and improve the entire engineering org. I haven't worked
      with another engineer who’s taken matters into his own hands on such a big and
      complex issue as [quality]. Avand is impressively product oriented in a way that
      enabled the team to ship more work. Avand is an enabler and a culture changer,
      and he does it not just through his passion and influence but also by cranking
      out high quality work that affects the entire company and improves our culture
      of quality.”

      of this in addition to his day-to-day engineering role, where he is greatly
      exceeding by inspiring, driving the team, and delivering results.”

      “It’s rare you find an engineer who cares as much about the design as they
      do the development of a product. Fortunately Avand is that engineer. He
      truly cares about the product and advocates for the customer. Even if it
      makes his role as an engineer more difficult, so long as it makes the
      product easier to use he’s all about it. You don’t find engineers like
      Avand everyday!”

      as I do, if not more, is Avand. He has a relentless, almost uncompromising
      desire to do the best possible work, whatever it might be. It’s incredibly
      refreshing. I’ve worked with Avand several times over the years, and I’ve
      never enjoyed working with anymore more—you’d be lucky to have a chance to
      work with him.”
