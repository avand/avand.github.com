  <p>Before I discovered the great world of open source software, I had spent much time in the Microsoft community. While a consultant at <a href="http://www.claritycon.com">Clarity Consulting</a>, I was staffed at Crate &amp; Barrel&#8217;s headquarters up in Northbrook, a Northern suburb of Chicago. I was responsible for the development of several core components of their furniture store point of sale system, most notably the new 8&#8221; x 11&#8221; receipts.  The point of sale was built on .NET and is to this day the largest code base to which I&#8217;ve contributed.</p>

  <h1>William Lawrence Camp</h1>

  <p>Going to an overnight summer camp as a kid is an experience that stays with you forever. I not only had this fortune but also accompanied my four camper years as a counselor for two. When I left camp to pursue my career and higher education, camp always remained in the back of my mind. One day it occurred to me that I could give back in more ways than just being there for the summer and took on a rewrite of the camp website. Search engine optimization was a big component in this process, and now the site <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=boys+summer+camp">ranks aggressively for key phrases</a>.</p>

  <p>If you&#8217;ve ever worked in an office or go out often with friends, you may have experienced the inconvenience of trying to split a bill. It was just this frustration that inspired me to build Piggy Back. Rather than trying to &#8220;settling up&#8221; every time you go out, use Piggy Back to let small debts between friends and family ride. By constantly balancing each transaction, Piggy Back finds the most efficient way for money to change hands.</p>

  <p>Ever since I can remember, I&#8217;ve loved racing. I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s the speed, the engineering, or the feeling of taking a perfect line through a turn. When I discovered <a href="http://www.chicagoindoorracing.com/">Chicago Indoor Racing</a>, I was ecstatic to be able to improve my driving abilities without emptying my entire wallet. I hope to one day work on customizing a car of my own, but in the meantime am satisfied drooling outside my neighborhood <a href="http://www.bentleygoldcoast.com/">Bentley Gold Coast dealership</a>.</p>

  <p>I have a thing for hats. And shoes. And occasionally, I&#8217;ll flip out over a cool t-shirt. Red also happens to be my favorite color. So, if you&#8217;re wondering about those KangaROOS, they&#8217;re on my wish-list (somehow, <a href="http://www.zappos.com">Zappos</a> doesn&#8217;t want to stock them). The way we look says so much about who we are and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever tire from defining my own style from the awesome fashions that surround us.</p>

  <p>Have you ever picked up a tool, or used a product that worked just the way you expected it to? I&#8217;m obsessed with that feeling. Conversely, I&#8217;m infuriated by anything deficient. Compare, for example, those glossy iPod music docks from Target to the water resistant rubberized Tivoli SongBook, which uses 4 rechargeable AA batteries, has a radio, and will work with anything that has a headphone jack. Products like the SongBook follow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Rams#Dieter_Rams.E2.80.99_ten_principles_to_.E2.80.9Cgood_design.E2.80.9D">Dieter Rams&#8217; 10 principles to &#8220;good design;&#8221;</a> principles that I arduously hold myself to when designing products and services.</p>
